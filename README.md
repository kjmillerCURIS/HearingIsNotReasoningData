# Benchmarks for ICML 2026 submission

In this repository, you will find the following benchmarks:

* **single-turn-emotions**: single\_turn\_data-for\_website.zip
* **emotional-conversations**: full\_conversation\_pair\_examples-for\_website.zip
* **positional-emotion**: full\_conversation\_pair\_strict\_positional\_emotion\_examples-for\_website.zip

These benchmarks each come with the same browser UI that was used by the human judges for human validation of the benchmarks. To view a benchmark:

* Download and unzip the .zip file.
* Go into the folder, and open the index.html file in your browser.
* Click "Pick Parent Folder" button (top left), and select the same folder from previous step. You should now see an example from the benchmark.
* You can use the "Prev"/"Next" buttons (or left/right arrow keys) to scroll between examples.
